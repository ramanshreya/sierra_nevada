# Analysing Data On Biodiversity In Spain's Sierra Nevada Mountains

This project aims to analyse data on plant species recorded on Sierra Nevada mountains in Spain. The area is a crucial biodiversity hotspot that is being impacted by climate change.

## Data

Two datasets were downloaded from Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). The first one, named "Sierra Nevada.csv" is the data in the long format which was used for analysing the entries based on class, genus and species. 

The second dataset, called "Sierra_species.csv" includes information based on IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species. Another file called "Sierra.csv" is a cleaned version of this dataset.

## Notebooks

I used Pandas for data analysing. The Sierra Nevada.ipynb notebook has all details of the analysis.

## Visualisations

The primary purpose and self-accepted challenge for this project was the visualisations. My aim was to step out of my comfort zone and explore with visualisation formats and techniques. The first visualisation was made using illustrator. I created each of the svgs based on references from the internet and used them to create an isotype chart.

The second visualisation was made on d3 using code from [this](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/circularpacking_template.html) template as a starting point.
